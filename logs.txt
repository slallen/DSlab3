create groups(names "ALL") that contains every member of the configuration file(except logger) to update timestamp to all nodes when need.

add a verbose option for send and recv, if multicast to ALL, will turn verbose to FALSE then will output nothing to screen.

(need discuss later)
for each multicast message, create another field called mul_start_timestamp. This value will record the timestamp when origin start to do this multicast. We will use this timestamp for multicast massage.
for example, if 4 nodes in group. start timestamp = 0. Origin should send 3 messages, all these three messages with mul_start_timestamp = 1. However the timestamp for each message is 1,2,3. 
Here for the timestamp, should it be 1,1,1 instead of 1,2,3?
When recv a multicast massage, will update local timestamp based on mul_start_timestamp. See MessagePasser.java line 177~182.

modify yaml parsing function to adjust to new type of configuration file.
